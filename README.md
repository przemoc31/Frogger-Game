"# Frogger" 
This is my own implementation of the "Frogger" game.
The main character that the player is playing in this game is a frog.
The purpose of the game is to move the frog to 5 finishing holes on the top of the map.
It's not that easy because the player has to avoid the cars, then jump over logs and turtles not to drown.
In the end, the player has to accurately hit into one of the free holes and repeat that 5 times. (Each time to different hole)
Player has only 5 lifes. The life can be lost by collision with car, drown in the water or losing on the time (50 seconds for each run).
During the game player is collecting points. Each move that gets the frog closer to the finish gives 10 points. 
Moreover, reaching the finishing hole gives much more bonus points depending on how fast the player achieved it.
After each game player can type his nickname and his score will be saved, if he managed to achieve one of the top 10 high scores.
Player can check out the high scores by clicking the "H" key when he is on the menu screen.
Enjoy the game!

The game is written in C using SDL library.
